       <h1>Missing you</h1>
       Dear Omolade,

<p>
     <ul>
          <li>
              At night,I lie down and imagine you are here with me .
               </li> 
        <li> 
            I didn't know just how heavy this seperation would be in my heart.
        </li> 
        <li> 
            I hope you are not in as muvh utter misery as i am without you.
        </li>
        <li>
            They say absence makes the heart grow founder,and my foundness has no bounds. 
        </li>
    </ul> 
    </p>

       
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I lie awake and feel the gentle warmth of your breath as it would fall on my cheek.
        </li> 
        <li>   
            I imagine the heat of your body pressed against the softness of mine; the hardness of your muscles nesting against the softness of mine.
         </li> 
        <li> 
            I turn and lay my head against the pillow, feeling your heartbeat drum lullaby in my ear.
        </li>
        <li> 
            A thousand butterflies kiss at my skin, and i long to feel yhe softness of your lips.
        </li>
    </ul>
    

    </p>    
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            While i know we will again be together, my yearning in your absence only cements the true depth of my passion.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Until i can see you and hold you again, you will remain ominipresent in my dreams.  
        </li>  
    </ul>
    
    </p>



      <p>Yours,

      <br>Omolade</br>
    </p>
